How to document objects (step-by-step)

1) make object (from template?)

2) - choose a similar max object and copy its reference file (xml in Max/patches/docs/refpages/) to ~/docs/refpages/, and edit it according to the new object

3) - register the new object in the "_c74_contents.xml" file in ~/docs/refpages/ta-ref/

4) - register the new object in the "ta-obj-list.txt" file in ~/init/

5) - register the new object in the "ta-obj-qlookup.json" file in ~/interfaces/

6) - make help file from ta.library.helpfile.maxhelp, found in ~/templates/
