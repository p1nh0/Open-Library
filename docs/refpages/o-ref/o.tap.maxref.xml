				Outputs the elapsed time in beats-per-minute from the currently received <m>bang</m> to the previous.

				Note: if the time between bangs is bigger than the <m>time-window</m> argument <o>o.tap</o> will reset its time count. This is quite useful in live performance situations, when you need to tap the tempo in two different sections, but you want to ignore the elapsed time between the first and the second tap situations.

				Time Window

			<description>
				A time window in milliseconds in which <o>o.tap</o> operates to calculate a bpm value. If the time elapsed between input <m>bangs</m> exceeds this value, <o>o.tap</o> will restart its elapsed time calculation, starting from 0 again.

			<description>
				Output the elapsed time in beats-per-minute between the two previous input <m>bangs</m>.

				<br /> 
				Note: when <o>o.tap</o> is instatiated, has received the <m>reset</m> or the elapsed time between input <m>bangs</m> is bigger than the <m>time-window</m> attribute, the object will only send values to the outlet after the second bang has been received. This can be quite useful in performance situations, where you don't want to output any values that aren't related to the time you are currently tapping.

			<description>
				Resets <o>o.tap</o> so that it will only output a tempo value after the second <m>bang</m> has been received.
				<br />
				<br /> 
				The <m>time-window</m> attribute will automatically reset <o>o.tap</o> when the interval between two <m>bangs</m> is bigger than the time-window value (in milliseconds).
