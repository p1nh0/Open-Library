How mxj code is presented as a standard ta.object: 

NOTE: the template contains a js object - mxj_deployer - which will deploy a mxj object containing the file you've just created, whenever you create a new max object with the same name (ex: "ta.yourobjname")


STEPS: 

1) Make mxj code and save it as ("ta.yourobjname.java"); 

2) Create a new max patcher from the template "ta.library.mxj_deployer.maxpat", located in the /templates folder. And save it with same name of the mxj file (ex: "ta.yourobjname.maxpat")
