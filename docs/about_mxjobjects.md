How mxj code is presented as a standard o.object: 

NOTE: the template contains a js object - mxj_deployer - which will deploy a mxj object containing the file you've just created, whenever you create a new max object with the same name (ex: "o.yourobjname")

STEPS: 
#1 - make mxj code and save it as ("o.yourobjname.java"); 
#2 - create a new max patcher from the template "o.library.mxj_deployer.maxpat", located in the /templates folder. And save it with same name of the mxj file (ex: "o.yourobjname.maxpat")
